Studying Express.js and architectures.

Week 1: Fundamentals of Express.js and Single Page Application (SPA)

Day 1-2: Start with the basics of Express.js. Study the official documentation, learn how to set up a basic Express.js server, and create your first API endpoints.
Day 3-4: Dive into JavaScript concepts and Node.js fundamentals to reinforce your understanding.
Day 5-7: Focus on SPA architecture using React. Learn how to create a basic React app and make API calls to your Express.js server. Explore client-side rendering (CSR) principles.
Week 2: Server-Rendered Application and RESTful API Architecture

Day 1-2: Learn about server-side rendering (SSR) with React and Next.js. Understand how to set up an Express.js server for SSR.
Day 3-4: Study RESTful API architecture. Learn about route handling in Express.js, request/response cycle, and best practices for designing RESTful APIs.
Day 5-7: Practice building a server-rendered application using Express.js and SSR with Next.js. Create additional RESTful API endpoints for your application.
Week 3: Microservices Architecture and GraphQL Architecture

Day 1-2: Explore the concept of microservices architecture. Learn how to break down an application into separate services and establish communication between them using Express.js.
Day 3-4: Study GraphQL architecture. Learn the basics of GraphQL, schemas, and resolvers.
Day 5-7: Implement a simple microservices-based application using Express.js and design a GraphQL API using Apollo Server.
Week 4: Authentication, Authorization, State Management, and Database Design

Day 1-2: Dive into authentication and authorization in the MERN stack. Learn about token-based authentication (JWT) and how to implement it with Express.js.
Day 3-4: Explore state management options. Study Redux and the React Context API. Decide which one to use based on the complexity of your application.
Day 5-6: Focus on MongoDB schema design. Learn how to structure your data efficiently and perform CRUD operations with Express.js and MongoDB.
Day 7: Review and practice what you've learned throughout the month. Build a small project that incorporates Express.js, React, authentication, state management, and database operations.
