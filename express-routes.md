_express.Router()_ is a method provided by the Express.js framework that creates a router object. Routers are used to organize and structure an Express.js application by encapsulating a specific set of routes and middleware.

A router object is like a mini-Express.js application that can define its own set of routes and middleware. You can then use this router object in your main Express.js application to handle requests for a specific set of URLs. This allows you to split your application into smaller, more manageable components.

Here is an example of how you might use a router in an Express.js application:  

Bring in express.js  
    `const express = require('express');` 

Instantiate express.js to make the object available.  
    `const app = express();`  

Acess the Router method on the express object  
    `const router = express.Router();`  

define a route that will handle HTTP GET requests. The first argument to the method is the URL pattern for the route, in this case `/`, which represents the root URL. The second argument is a callback function that will be executed when the route is matched.  
`router.get('/',`  

The second argument/ callback function takes two arguments: req and res. req is an object that represents the _incoming HTTP request_, and res is an object that represents the outgoing HTTP response.  
    `(req, res) => {`  

the res.send() method to send a simple "Hello, World!" response. When a client makes a GET request to the root URL, the server will match this route, execute the callback function, and send the "Hello, World!" response back to the client.  
  `res.send('Hello, World!');`  
`});`  
  

The app.use() method is used to mount the router object in the main Express.js application, so that it will handle requests to the root URL.  
    `app.use('/', router);`  
    
The app.listen() method is used to start the HTTP web server and begin handling incoming requests. The first parameter is the port 3000 and the second is a callback function.  

When the server is ready to start accepting requests, the second parameter which is a callback function passed to app.listen() will be executed and a message will be logged to the console indicating that the server is listening on port 3000.  
    `app.listen(3000, () => {`  
      `console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');`  
    `});`  

# To learn routes in Express, I would suggest the following steps:  
  
- Get a basic understanding of HTTP and the different types of requests and responses.  
  
- Learn the basics of Express by reading the official documentation and following tutorials. This will help you understand how to create an Express application, define routes, and handle requests and responses.  
  
- Practice creating simple routes in Express, such as a route that returns a static HTML file or a route that returns JSON data.  

- Learn about routing parameters in Express, which allow you to capture values from the URL and use them in your route handler function.  
  
- Practice creating routes that use different types of HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and learn how to handle different types of requests and responses for each method.  
  
- Explore more advanced topics in routing, such as middleware functions, error handling, and authentication.  
  
- Read the Express documentation and experiment with different routing techniques and features to deepen your understanding of the framework.
