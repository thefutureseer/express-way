_express.Router()_ is a method provided by the Express.js framework that creates a router object. Routers are used to organize and structure an Express.js application by encapsulating a specific set of routes and middleware.

A router object is like a mini-Express.js application that can define its own set of routes and middleware. You can then use this router object in your main Express.js application to handle requests for a specific set of URLs. This allows you to split your application into smaller, more manageable components.

Here is an example of how you might use a router in an Express.js application:  

//Bring in express.js  
    `const express = require('express');` 

//Instantiate express.js to make the object available.  
    `const app = express();`
  

//Acess the Router method on the express object  
    `const router = express.Router();`  
  

    //define a route that will handle HTTP GET requests. The first argument to the method is the URL pattern for the route, in this case '/', which represents the root URL. The second argument is a callback function that will be executed when the route is matched.  

    router.get('/', 

//The callback function takes two arguments: req and res. req is an object that represents the incoming HTTP request, and res is an object that represents the outgoing HTTP response.  

    (req, res) => { 
//the res.send() method to send a simple "Hello, World!" response. When a client makes a GET request to the root URL, the server will match this route, execute the callback function, and send the "Hello, World!" response back to the client.  
      res.send('Hello, World!');
    });  
//The app.use() method is used to mount the router object in the main Express.js application, so that it will handle requests to the root URL.  

    app.use('/', router);  

    //The app.listen() method is used to start the HTTP web server and begin handling incoming requests. The first parameter is the port 3000 and the second is a callback function. 
    //When the server is ready to start accepting requests, the callback function passed to app.listen() will be executed and a message will be logged to the console indicating that the server is listening on port 3000.
  
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
    });
