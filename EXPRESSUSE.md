In Express, 
# the .use() method  

## Provided by the express module.  
The implementation of .use() is a simple function:  
### adds a middleware function to an internal array of middleware functions.  
When a request is received, Express processes the middleware functions in the order in which they were added, calling each function in turn with the req, res, and next objects.

Here is a simplified version of the .use() function in Express _under the hood_ which means:  
### This is the unseen code doing the magic for the express.use() method.  


        const express = require('express');
        const app = express();

        app.middleware = [];

        app.use = function(fn) {
          this.middleware.push(fn);
        };

        app.handle = function(req, res) {
          let i = 0;

          function next() {
            const fn = app.middleware[i++];
            if (!fn) {
              return;
            }
            fn(req, res, next);
          }

          next();
        };

        app.listen = function(port) {
          // code to start the HTTP server and listen for incoming requests
        };  

### This is the unseen code doing the magic for the express.use() method.  

Code explained:  
In this code, the app object is created using the express() function. The .use() method is then added to the app object as a property, and the middleware array is also added to the app object to store the middleware functions.  


The .use() method simply pushes a new function onto the end of the middleware array. The handle function is then defined to process the incoming requests. It uses a simple loop to call each function in the middleware array in turn, passing req, res, and next as arguments.  


Finally, the listen function is defined to start the HTTP server and listen for incoming requests. The actual implementation of the listen function would include code to create an HTTP server, bind to a port, and handle incoming requests by calling the handle function.  


Note:  
 This code is a simplified example for illustration purposes only. The actual implementation of Express is more complex and includes many additional features and optimizations. But the basic idea is the same: the .use() method adds middleware functions to an array, and the request processing loop calls each function in turn to process the incoming request and generate the outgoing response.
