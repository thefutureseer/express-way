_express.js_: is a popular web application framework for Node.js that provides a set of robust features and tools for building web applications and APIs. Express is built on top of the core Node.js HTTP module and provides an easier and more structured way to handle HTTP requests and responses.  

# HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is a protocol used to send and receive data over the internet. HTTP is a client-server protocol, which means that requests are initiated by the recipient of the request (by the client to the server) and sent to the server. The server then sends back a response to the client.  
  
  ## There are several types of _HTTP requests_ , but the most common ones are:  

- GET: retrieves data from a server
- POST: sends data to a server to create or update a resource
- PUT: sends data to a server to update an existing resource
- DELETE: deletes a resource on the server  

  _HTTP responses_ are the messages sent by the server back to the client in response to an HTTP request.  
_HTTP responses_ contain a status code, a message, and optional headers and a body. The most common status codes are:  

200 OK: the request was successful
201 Created: the request was successful and a new resource was created
400 Bad Request: the request was malformed or invalid
401 Unauthorized: the request requires authentication
404 Not Found: the requested resource was not found on the server
500 Internal Server Error: there was an error on the server  

  Understanding the basics of HTTP and its different types of requests and responses is essential for developing web applications, as it allows you to create efficient and effective communication between clients and servers.
