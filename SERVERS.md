# What is a server? Simple..  

## A server is:  

- Servers provide functionality to other computer systems or programs, known as clients. The client sends a request to the server, which then performs some action and returns a response.
  
- In the context of the web, a server is a program that listens for incoming HTTP *requests*, processes the *requests*, and returns a *response* to the client. This *response* can be in the form of a web page, an image, a file, or data in a specific format, such as JSON.
  
## A server is basically 2 things:  
  
## 1. computer system:  
A *server* computer system is a computer designed to provide resources and services to other computers or devices on a network. This can include file storage, data processing, and other services.  
#### Here are some of the most common key components of a server *computer system*:
  
  CPU:  
The CPU (central processing unit) is the heart of the server and is responsible for executing instructions and processing data. Servers typically use high-performance CPUs to handle large amounts of requests simultaneously.  
  
  RAM:  
RAM (random access memory) is used to store data temporarily while the CPU processes it. Servers typically have large amounts of RAM to ensure they can efficiently process and store data.  
  
  Storage:  
Servers usually have high-capacity storage, such as multiple hard drives or solid-state drives, to store the data that they serve to clients. Some servers use specialized storage systems, such as network-attached storage (NAS) or storage area networks (SAN), to manage large amounts of data.  
  
  Network interface:  
Servers have a network interface that allows them to communicate with other devices over a network, such as the internet. The network interface can be a physical card installed in the server or an integrated component on the motherboard.  
  
  Operating system:  
  Servers run an operating system, such as Windows Server, Linux, or Unix, that provides the foundation for the server and allows other software to run on it. The operating system is responsible for managing the server's hardware, security, and network communication.

These are some of the most common key components of a server computer system. The specific components and configurations can vary depending on the type and purpose of the server.

## _and a_ 

## 2. program:  
A server program, on the other hand, is a program that runs on a server computer system and provides specific services or resources to clients over a network. For example, a web server is a program that listens for incoming HTTP requests from clients and returns HTTP responses, while a file server is a program that provides access to files over a network.

In practice, the terms "server computer system" and "server program" are often used interchangeably, as the distinction is not always important. For example, one might say "I have a server running on my computer" to refer both to the computer system and the server program running on it.  

Express is a tool that makes it easier to build and run a server program, while a server computer system is the machine on which the program runs. The server program built using Express runs on a server computer system, providing services or resources to clients over a network.


## all servers serve a similar purpose: to provide a service or resources to clients.  

Express itself does not offer different types of servers, but it provides a set of tools and features that can be used to build a variety of server applications.  

Here are some examples of server applications that can be built using Express:  

1. Web servers:  
Express makes it easy to implement HTTP servers that serve web pages and web APIs.  

2. RESTful APIs:  
Express provides a routing system and support for middleware that can be used to implement RESTful APIs.  

3. Static file servers:  
Express can be used to serve static files, such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.  

4. Proxy servers:  
Express can be used to implement a reverse proxy server that forwards requests from clients to one or more upstream servers.

5. Real-time applications:  
Express can be used in combination with real-time technologies such as WebSockets to build real-time applications, such as chat applications and multiplayer games.  
  
  These are just a few examples of the types of servers that can be built using Express. The specific type of server you build will depend on your use case and requirements.  


*The most common types of servers* in general are web servers, database servers, and file servers.  


1. Web servers:  
Web servers are the most commonly used type of server on the internet. They serve up websites and web applications, responding to HTTP requests and delivering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the client's web browser. Some popular web servers include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.

2. Database servers:  
Database servers are an essential component of many applications and are used to store and manage data. The most common types of database servers are relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server, as well as NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra.

3. File servers:  
File servers are used to store and manage file storage, serving files to clients on a network or over the internet. They are commonly used in business and enterprise environments to provide centralized storage and collaboration for teams.  

4. Application servers:  
These servers host and run business applications, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and so on.  

5. Email servers:  
These servers manage the sending and receiving of email messages, providing email services to clients.  

6. Proxy servers:  
These servers act as intermediaries between clients and other servers, providing security, privacy, and optimization services.  

7. Print servers:  
These servers manage printers and print jobs, allowing clients to send print jobs to networked printers.  

8. Gaming servers:  
These servers host and manage online multiplayer games, allowing players to connect and play together.  

9. FTP servers:  
These servers provide file transfer services, allowing clients to upload and download files.  


  There are many different types of servers, each with a specific purpose and function. These are the most commonly used and are often used in combination to build complex, scalable applications and systems.  

### The most common response *types _from_ a server:

1. HTML:  
HTML is the most common response type from a server when serving up web pages. It provides the structure and content for the page, which is then rendered by the client's web browser.

2. JSON:  
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is commonly used for data transfer in APIs and web services. It is easy to read and write for both humans and machines, making it a popular choice for data exchange.

3. Error messages:  
Error messages are a common type of response from a server, indicating that a request could not be processed. They can be in various formats, such as plain text, HTML, or JSON, and can provide details about the error that occurred.

4. XML:  
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language that is commonly used for data exchange in APIs and web services. It provides a way to structure data in a hierarchical manner and is a flexible format that can be used for a wide range of purposes.

5. CSV:  
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple text format for representing data in a tabular form. It is commonly used for data exchange, especially for data that is meant to be imported into spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

6. Images:  
The server can return images in various formats, such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF, which can be displayed in the client's web browser or another image viewing application.

7. PDF:  
PDF (Portable Document Format) is a popular file format for documents that are meant to be printed or viewed on a wide range of devices. The server can return a PDF file, which can be viewed in a PDF reader like Adobe Acrobat.

8. Audio and video:  
The server can return audio and video files in various formats, such as MP3, MP4, and AVI, which can be played in media players like VLC or QuickTime.

- Web servers are the backbone of the internet, serving up the websites and web applications that people access every day. When you request a website in your web browser, the browser sends a request to the server hosting that website, and the server returns the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up the website's content.  

#### With Express the most common requests from the client to the server you'll handle are HTTP requests. Here are some of the most common HTTP requests that you may encounter:  


GET requests:  
A GET request is used to retrieve information from the server. In the context of a web server, GET requests are often used to retrieve HTML pages, images, and other static resources.  


POST requests:  
A POST request is used to submit data to the server. In the context of a web server, POST requests are often used to submit forms, upload files, or perform other actions that modify server-side data.  


PUT requests:  
A PUT request is used to update an existing resource on the server.  


DELETE requests:  
A DELETE request is used to delete a resource on the server.  


HEAD requests:  
A HEAD request is similar to a GET request, but it only returns the headers of the response, not the body. HEAD requests are often used to retrieve metadata about a resource, such as its size or last-modified date.  


..Depending on your use case and requirements, you may also need to handle other types of requests, such as PATCH requests or OPTIONS requests.
